# Welcome!

My name is Ruoxuan Li. I am a current second-year PhD student in the Biomedical Sciences Training Program at Case Western Reserve University, where I am pursuing the Cancer Biology track and working in Dr. Mark Jackson's laboratory. My research focuses on advancing innovative therapies to improve outcomes for patients with triple-negative breast cancer, a challenging and aggressive subtype with limited treatment options.

In particular, I am investigating the development of Nanobody-Based CAR-T therapy for Triple-Negative Breast Cancer. My research combines cutting-edge techniques in molecular biology, immunology, and genetic engineering to enhance the therapeutic potential of CAR-T cells.

Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:rxl884@case.edu) if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects!
